# Ethiopian Agriculture Project
This project consists of digitization of of regional agricultural reports and tools for linking to GIS data.

## CSA Records
The [Central Statistical Agency](https://www.statsethiopia.gov.et) has published regional level aggregates for surveys of individual smallholder farmers in pdf format. I have digitized these records and made the data available in a tidy format for the years 1995-2000.

## GIS Files
I provide shapefiles for the regions reported above that can be linked to sources of geographic data such as rainfall.

## Ethiopian Rural Household Survey
Dataset available [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:1902.1/15646) via the Harvard Dataverse. I provide code for linking these study villages to GIS data.
